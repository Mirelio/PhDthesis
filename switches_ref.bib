	The toggle switch based on mutual inhibition whose reaction kinetic characteristics described by a pair of ODEs. These equations predict at  most two stable steady states and one unstable steady state. But stochastic fluctuations are not negligible, so exact stochastic simulation via kinetic monte carlo (KMC) algorithm used.
	Here experimentally and theoretically revealed an additional kinetic stable state nearby the traditionally regarded unstable ss. System from monostable to twistable under different conditions. Source of additional kinetic stability: the discrete and fluctuate nature of molecule numbers, especially when they are often very close or equal to zero.
