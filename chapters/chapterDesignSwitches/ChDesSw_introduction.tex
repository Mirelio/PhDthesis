\section{Introduction}

In the previous Chapters I studied the effect that adding positive feedback loops to the genetic toggle switch has on the robustness of the system. In this Chapter I provide the experimental design for the construction of the genetic toggle switch with single and double positive autoregulation in the lab. 

Structurally, this Chapter is organised as follows: First I provide an overview of the cloning plan, by listing the relevant BioBrick parts used and their interactions. Then I outline the methods that are used during the cloning procedure and finally I provide the experimental design for producing these switches.
