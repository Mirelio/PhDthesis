\section{Evaluation}


In this thesis I studied the genetic toggle switch computationally and experimentally. 



The work presented here advances our understanding of the design of novel switches as well as of existing


\section{Future perspectives}

The construction of the novel synthetic switch designs will enable the experimental verification of system robustness. The new switches can be characterized using ABC-Flow to compare the parameter values that produce a bistable switch. This will allow the creation of a parts library that can be used for the switch, and each design can be used for the appropriate application.

The realisation of the multistable switches would be the next step from StabilityFinder. It would open the doors for some interesting applications of the multistable switches.
