\section{Abstract}
Creating synthetic devices that are robust to changing cellular contexts will be key to the success of 
synthetic biology. When faced with a set of competing designs for a given genetic circuit one is likely 
to choose the simplest possible model that can achieve the desired behaviour. However simple systems are 
often the least robust and it is known that additional feedback interactions can increase robustness to 
extrinsic noise sources. The genetic toggle switch is examined, consisting of two mutually repressing 
transcription factors. It is known for exhibiting bistability, and is found in natural systems when 
binary fate decisions need to be made, such as in a developmental pathway. It can also be used in 
synthetic systems to sense and respond to different environments.
\noindent
Here a new tool is presented, called StabilityChecker, that takes advantage of sequential Monte Carlo to 
identify regions of parameter space capable of producing the desired stability while handling uncertainty 
in biochemical rate constants and initial conditions. StabilityChecker is tested against known systems. A 
collection of networks are examined, ranging from the simple genetic toggle switch to those containing different 
positive feedback connections. 
\noindent
We verify StabilityChecker against known results of the simple toggle switch. We find that positive feedback 
and other regulatory interactions can significantly increase the robustness of these switching systems.
