SUMMARY:
*	Modularity
*	Switches robust to noise, used as useful biological machines
*	eg. production therapeutic compounds only in appropriate context
*	Increase complexity by adding third repressor. 
*	coupled positive and negative feedback loops can maintain oscillations robustly. Time delay might be critical for oscillations to occur

	Complex signalling systems (like circadian clocks) challenge to study design principles: never sure all components have been identified, unknown parameters for the known components. Here: Studied minimal gene circuitry required for generating oscillations in gene expression in vivo. Constructed a synthetic genetic circuit that produces damped oscillations with a circadian period in E.coli.
	The first attempts at constructing a toggle switch (Gardner) demonstrated bistability ad hysteresis. Oscillator (Elowitz) is the represilator.
 	Barkai {\&}amp; Leibler described model gene circuit consisting of an activator and a repressor. With appropriate parameters model produced sustained oscillations and was resistant to noise
	Model here similar to Barkai theoretical model. An activator module forms a positive auto regulatory circuit linked to a repressor module. Unique in that the repressor directly represses transcription of the activator gene, as opposed to antagonising activator activity. 
	Design space in which the effects of all parameters represented (Fig. 1B). Any particular design represented by a point within one of the sectors in this space. Each sector associated with distinct behaviours.
	Once one constructed initial circuit, behaviour will suggest its location in design space. Initial location suggests parameter alterations that will move it into region producing desired behaviour.

	System produce toggle switch behaviour when parameters place it in sectors 2 or 3 of design space. The concentration of repressor at which switching occurs will depend on the history of the system.
	At intermediate repressor concentrations there is an unstable state. Two different steady states depending on the system history.
	The genetic systems produced damped oscillations or toggle-switch behaviour in a noise resistant fashion in large population of cells.
